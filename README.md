Microverse Capstone Project

# Rock Concert Page
It is a front-end web development project. This project is about building a website for a concert using technologies like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. In this project, we have a portal and two links, one is the about page and the other to book tickets for the concert.
It's a responsive project suitable for mobile and desktop views. The purpose of this project is to create a meaningful website for the production company whose job is to create the event and also provide the possibilities for users to schedule and buy the ticket only.
